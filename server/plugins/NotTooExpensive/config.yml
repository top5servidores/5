Anvil Max Repair Cost: 2147483600
# Set the max cost for an anvil actions (In Lvl's)
# It may say too expensive on a clients screen, But it is just fibbing.
# Keep it at least a few levels below the 32-Bit int

Anvil Reset Max Repair Cost: 39
# Should the plugin reset the repair cost of this action to the above value if it costs more than this level?
# Note: clients will not display this correctly if the value is >39
#       Instead it will display the cost as hotbar message.
# Note: Will only be checked if it is below or equal to "Anvil Max Repair Cost"

# Display (Hotbar)
Anvil Too Expensive MSG: "&7(&6Anvil&7) &cToo Expensive &7(&b%lvl%&7)"
Anvil Overflow Level MSG: "&7(&6Anvil&7) &aEnchantment Cost: &7(&b%lvl%&7)"
Not Enough Levels MSG: "&7(&6Anvil&7) &cYou need to be level &7(&b%lvl%&7)&c to do this"

Item Repair Cost TAG Limit: 20
# This not only gives control over the cumulative repair cost of an item,
# It also can be used to prevent the scenario of an item reaching the 32bit int limit of repair cost
# and thus the system not allowing further repairs

# When set with "Enable Item Tag Cap Reset: true" It will clamp the tag.RepairCost nbt of
# Any item in the Anvil to this level. Preventing the repairs from getting more expensive
# Just by repairing the item. Note: The use of an anvil can still get more expensive with more enchantments etc

Enable Item Tag Cap Reset: false
# If this is enabled you need to install ItemNBTApi
