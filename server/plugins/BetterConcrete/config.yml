# Cauldron options
## check_empty: If set to 0: players will be able to transfer items in any cauldron.
##			    If set to 1: players will be able to transfer items in non empty cauldrons.
##			    If set to 2: players will be able to transfer items in cauldrons with higher or equal waterlevel than needed for one transformation (change_waterlevel)
## change_waterlevel: Cauldrons will change their waterlevel by the given amount if a player transforms items (the amount of items is unnecessary). Note: A full cauldron has water level 3.
## call_event: This is just for compatibility reasons with other plugins. If set to true other plugins will get notified (CauldronLevelChangeEvent) of water level changes with unknown reason.
